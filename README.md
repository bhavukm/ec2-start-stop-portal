# A Bash Script based User Interactive Portal to Start and Stop AWS EC2 Instances

**Problem Statement**: A manager who manages multiple developers working on various applications deployed on multiple AWS EC2 Instances has been advised by Senior Management to regulary stop a few instances when the developers are not using them. This is to support **AWS Cost Optimzation** project currently happening in the company. The problem is that the manager has no knowledge on how to use AWS Management console or CLI to start/stop these instances. He has asked for a **User Interface** to do this.

**Solution**: The DevOps team came up with an idea of building a Bash Script based **User Interactive Portal** to enable the developer manager to start/stop these instances.
